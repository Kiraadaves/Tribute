    <p>Eternal lights flicker in a distant sky. Where have you gone? Why did you die?. I look to the heavens, hoping to see you anew, where have you gone? I am searching for you daddy. The painful cries...silent tears...the sadness where laughter use to be...I miss you daddy. Home isn't home anymore. There's an emptiness now that only you could fill.
    	<br>No farewell words were spoken, no time to say goodbye. You were gone before we knew it and only God knows why. My heart still aches with sadness and secret tears still flow. <br>
    	What it meant to love you, no one can ever know, What it meant to be loved by you, no one would ever understand. What an amazing father you were, no one would ever comprehend.<br> I know you want me to mourn no more, but how can I Daddy? When all the lovely memories of you betray me each time. I promise not to forget your face, your smile, your love, your kindness. Growing up I always felt untouchable because of you. No one could harm me because you were always there.<br><br>
    	I wish we had more time...<br>
    	I know you are in my heart, but i long to see your face. Memories of yesterday leave only a trace.
